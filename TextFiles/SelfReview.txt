SELF REVIEW

What do you wish you had done differently in your design/implementation?
Did you learn any lessons from the code given to you, or the updates you had to make for
your customers?
What was your experience like with your providers?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The only thing we'd do differently about our own implementation is having an interface for
StratMove that outlines the public methods we use in the current class. Then, in the Strategies
interface, we’d change the signature for strategize() to return the StratMove interface instead of
the concrete class. Despite this, our providers didn't contact us about any issues to fix. They
just had one question about how our PlayingCard and StratMove interfaces work, and we explained
how they were actually classes and what they each did.
What we learned from the code given to us is that it's very important to have loose coupling
between packages so you can re-implement and reuse code afterward. Also, we learned from the
provider’s code that it’s very important to not over-organize things by, for example, creating
lots of packages within packages.
